# Smartwatch swimming style and drowning detection DNN model

The method of this repository is the same as my [Sensor Human Action Recognition Model Repository](https://github.com/farhantandia/Sensor-Human-Action-Recognition-Model), the data and designed deep neural network is different. We use LSTM for swimming style and drowning detection using wearable data. We collect the dataset using our own smartwatch wear os sensor data collecter as you can check [here](https://github.com/farhantandia/Wearable-Sensor-Data-Collector).

## Dependencies
- Tensorflow 1.14

## Deployment
You can save the model as frozen protobuf file and use our action recognition wear os application [here](https://github.com/farhantandia/Smartwatch-drowning-detection) <br>.
